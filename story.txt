Once upon a time there was a guy named Grant (this meets the character requirement) who was in a forest (this meets the setting requirement).
He found a pizza still hot and in the box and ate it. Then he was full.
After 30 minutes, he felt thirsty and came back to the store and ordered a bottle of Coke. 
He couldn't wait till he got home, so he went outside the store and opened the bottle in a hurry. 
The fizz was too strong, and Grant was drenched in coke. 
He didn't have enough money for another bottle, so he went back home with a frown on his face.

Thankfully, a stranger walked up to Grant on his walk home and offered him a liquid in a red solo cup.
Grant was thristy that he gulped the murky liquid down without hesitation.
