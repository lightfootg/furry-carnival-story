Once upon a time there was a guy named Grant (this meets the character requirement) who was in a forest (this meets the setting requirement).
He found a pizza still hot and in the box and ate it. Then he was full.
After 30 minutes, he felt thirsty and came back to the store and ordered a bottle of Coke.
